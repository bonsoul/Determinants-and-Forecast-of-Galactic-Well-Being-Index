# Determinants-and-Forecast-of-Galactic-Well-Being-Index

1. Objective

The primary aim of this study was to:

    Identify the demographic and socio-economic variables that best explain the variation in the well-being index of galaxies.

    Predict the future well-being index for a set of galaxies using observed data.

2. Methodology

The analysis was based on a structured dataset comprising socio-economic indicators and observed well-being indices for various galaxies. Key steps in the process included:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Assessed the distribution and correlation of variables with the well-being index.

    Feature Selection & Modeling: Applied regression-based techniques and machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest) to identify the most impactful predictors.

    Prediction: The trained model was used to generate predictions for galaxies in the validation dataset.

3. Key Determinants of Well-Being

The following variables were identified as the strongest predictors of well-being across galaxies:

    Income per Capita: Higher income levels were positively correlated with well-being.

    Education Index: A strong positive contributor; galaxies with greater educational attainment scored higher.

    Healthcare Access: Availability and quality of healthcare services significantly impacted well-being.

    Employment Rate: Economically active populations tended to show better well-being metrics.

    Environmental Quality: Clean, sustainable environments were associated with higher well-being.

    Social Support Indicators: Metrics related to community cohesion and support also played a role.

These findings highlight the multidimensional nature of well-being, integrating economic, social, and environmental factors.
4. Future Predictions

Using the derived model, future well-being index values were predicted for the validation dataset. These predictions provide valuable insights for galactic policy-making and resource allocation aimed at improving overall well-being.

5. Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that well-being is driven by a combination of socio-economic and environmental factors. Predictive modeling offers a powerful tool for anticipating future trends and guiding evidence-based interventions across galaxies.
